This project was started in the summer of 2021 and is currently under casual development.<br><br>
It is intended to be an adventure game where players will interact and explore a maze, with one of the players acting as a server. The players will
search for keys, which they will use to open a final challenge located at the center of the maze (reminiscent of the Dark Tower board game). The first player 
to complete the challenge will win. The players can purchase weapons, ammunition, food, and other supplies at various markets in the maze. In addition to 
fighting each other, the players will encounter various hostile creatures.
